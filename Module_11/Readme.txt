The following scripts are used to demonstrate recursion in assembly as part of Miriam Lorbert's Computer Oganization Course

# Descriptions

# Fibonacci.s

This script provides the nth fibonacci number, with n being defined by the user input.  This is accomplished through recursion whereby fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2), with the end state being that fib(1) and fib(2) == 1

# Mult.s

This script provides the product of integers m and n, each of which is defined by user input.  This is accomplished by recursion whereby m x n = m + m x (n - 1)
